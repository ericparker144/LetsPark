# LetsPark

This repo contains the source code for a mobile application developed during my time working with Dr. Mehdi Kargar as part of the University of Windsor’s Outstanding Scholars program.

The application was developed using Apache Cordova with the Ionic framework, and consumes the REST API that can be found in my “LetsParkServer” repository.
